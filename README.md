# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash. The .dotfile directory holds all of the files necessary for git. These include the directories ./bin and ./etc which hold the files .vimrc, .bashrc, cleanup.sh, and linus.sh.
## .vimrc
This is my custom .vimrc configuration for Vim. The vimrc file is used to set all of the requirements for what the page looks like. It includes the syntax, number, autoindent, ruler, color, and nonexpandable files.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash. The .bashrc file gives alias to the work that is given to github. This inclues alias for the command ls, cd, ls -l, and ls -a. It allows the github configurations to be easier to perform. Gives the code function using variables.
